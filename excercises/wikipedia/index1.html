        Bieber's fourth studio album, Purpose, was released in 2015. It was preceded by "Where Are Ü Now", a collaboration with Jack Ü, which saw Bieber explore EDM, and win the Grammy Award for Best Dance Recording. Purpose embodied a multi-genre production and produced three U.S. number-one singles: "Love Yourself", "Sorry", and "What Do You Mean?". He became the first artist in history to occupy the entire top three of the U.K. singles chart, as the singles charted at positions 1, 2 and 3 simultaneously. Bieber diversified on numerous collaborations between 2016 and 2017 including DJ Khaled's "I'm the One", which reached number one on the US Billboard Hot 100. A week later, he released his remix to Luis Fonsi and Daddy Yankee's "Despacito", claiming his subsequent chart-topper. It tied the then-record for most weeks atop the Billboard Hot 100 and made Bieber the first artist in history to chart new number-one singles in consecutive weeks. As of September 2021, "Despacito" holds the number-one position on the Greatest of All Time Hot Latin Songs chart. In 2019, he released a country collaboration with Dan + Shay, "10,000 Hours", for which he won the Grammy Award for Best Country Duo/Group Performance.

        They were tulips. I wanted them to be peonies. In my story, they are, they will be, they were and will for ever be peonies – for, when I am writing, space and time itself bend to my will! Through the medium of tenses! In real life, the dog kennel is where I make my home. When I was a kid, I thought I’d rather be a brain in a jar than a ‘natural woman’. I have turned out to be some odd combination of both, from moment to moment, and with no control over when and where or why those moments occur. Whether the ‘natural’ part of my womanhood is an essential biological fact or an expression (as de Beauvoir argued) of an acculturation so deep it looks very much like roots growing out of the bulb, at this point in my life I confess I don’t know and I don’t care. I am not a scientist or a sociologist. I’m a novelist. Who can admit, late in the day, during this strange and overwhelming season of death that collides, outside my window, with the emergence of dandelions, that spring sometimes rises in me, too, and the moon may occasionally tug at my moods, and if I hear a strange baby cry some part of me still leaps to attention – to submission. And once in a while a vulgar strain of spring flower will circumvent a long-trained and self-consciously strict downtown aesthetic. Just before an unprecedented April arrives and makes a nonsense of every line.
